# 2016-child-theme-for-indieweb
A somewhat customized child theme for WordPress's Twenty Sixteen standard theme.

## Documentation
I've tried to comment various portions of the code so that it's reasonably readable and a person using this will know what each individual section is doing or changing.

Many portions have simple CSS that can easily be excluded.

Some portions detail pieces that require particular IndieWeb specific plugins and may cause errors if they're not included.

The footer.php file has a hard-coded link to the wiki for an indieweb icon that can be found on the wiki/github repository. It's recommneded that it is downloaded and linked directly on one's own site so that if the original copy should disappear, it won't break your site. Simply replace the URL for the image on the wiki to the URL for the image on yours.

No warranty is expressed or implied, so please use at your own risk.
